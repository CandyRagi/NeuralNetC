# Neural Networks from Scratch in C++

A lightweight implementation of neural networks built entirely from scratch in modern C++. No external ML libraries—just raw math and algorithms.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Understand neural networks at the foundational level
- Implement backpropagation, activation functions, and optimizers from scratch
- Build a clean, modular, and efficient codebase in C++

---

## ✨ Features

- Fully connected neural networks
- Multiple activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh)
- Backpropagation with gradient descent
- Customizable network architecture
- Model save/load functionality

---

## 🛠️ Requirements

- C++17 or higher
- CMake 3.15+
